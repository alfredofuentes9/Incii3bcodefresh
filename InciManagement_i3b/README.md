# InciManager
This module allows Agents to create new incidents and view their previously created incidents.
In order to deploy it you must first download [Apache Kafka](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/kafka/1.0.1/kafka_2.11-1.0.1.tgz) and deploy it, then run the application and connect to it at localhost:8080
The module also requires MongoDB, that can be downloaded [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community), to be executed beforehand.
